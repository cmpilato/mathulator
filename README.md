Mathmulator
===========

The Mathmulator is a simple arithmetic problem solver with a
command-line interface.  At the moment, it supports only very basic
two-input calculations:

* addition: 2 + 5 = 7
* subtraction: 5 - 2 = 3
* multiplication: 5 * 2 = 10
* division: 5 / 2 = 2.5
* modulo: 5 % 2 = 1
* power: 5 ^ 2 = 25
