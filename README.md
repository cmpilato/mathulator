Mathmulator
===========

The Mathmulator is a simple arithmetic problem solver with a
command-line interface.  At the moment, it supports only very basic
two-input calculations:

* addition: 2 + 5 = 7
* subtraction: 5 - 2 = 3
* multiplication: 5 * 2 = 10
* division: 5 / 2 = 2.5
* modulo: 5 % 2 = 1
* power (exponents): 5 ^ 2 = 25
* logical AND: 5 & 6 = 4
* logical OR: 5 | 6 = 7

Usage
-----

Interaction with the Mathmulator begins by invoking the tool.  Do this
by running `program`.

```
$ ./program
Enter an expression (use spaces): 
```

(Note that on Windows, this process may be a bit more involved.)
